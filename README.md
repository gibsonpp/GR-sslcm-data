### Description

**Data access date:** 2023-05-02

This data set describes the *abundance* of natural-origin juvenile
Chinook salmon observed passing rotary screw traps as the fish move
downstream out of spawning areas in the headwaters.

Abundance is measured using rotary screw traps, located near the lower
extent of spawning in each population. Generally the screw traps operate
during two seasons, corresponding to the primary periods of fish
movement: fall (early migrants) and spring (late migrants). In general
ice cover (winter) and high temperatures (summer) prevent the traps from
operating year-round, although the trap on the Lostine River is usually
able to operate through most of the winter. Very few fish are caught
during this winter period.

Mark-recapture trials for measuring the efficiency of the screw traps
are conducted by releasing marked fish above the trap throughout the
sampling season (Volkhardt et al. 2007). Up through migration year 2019,
abundance was calculated using the Lincoln-Petersen estimator, with no
attempt to account for missed trapping days. For migration years 2020
and later, abundance was estimated using a generalized additive model
with a penalized spline smooth term, which smooths the curve for
estimated daily abundance passing the trap and interpolates for missed
trapping days during the sampling season (Duarte and Peterson 2020). For
all years, variance of the abundance estimates was estimated using the
one-sample bootstrap method (Thedinga et al. 1994).

Because rotary screw traps only catch fish moving downstream past the
trap, they do not count fish that were spawned downstream of the trap.
To account for the contribution of any downstream spawning to juvenile
production, in this data set the estimated number of fish passing the
screw trap is expanded by the ratio of the number of redds (from the
appropriate brood year) counted above the screw trap to the total number
of redds counted in the population for that brood year.

**Years of data:** 29 (BY 1992 - 2020)
- CAT: 28 years (BY 1993-2020)
- LOS: 25 years (BY 1995-2020; missing BY 2002)
- MIN: 22 years (BY 1999-2020)
- UGR: 28 years (BY 1992-2020; missing part of BY 2019)

### Notes and limitations

The primary limitation affecting migrant abundance estimates from screw
traps is missed trapping days during the migration period: traps
sometimes must be shut down for heavy debris loads, ice cover, or very
high flows, and data may be unusable due to, for example, a log jamming
the trap. In the pre-2019 abundance estimates, no attempt was made to
account for these missed days. Additionally, any migrants that pass the
trap before the start or after the end of trapping are not counted in
the abundance estimates.

At the CAT trap site, substantial numbers of young-of-year fish are
regularly observed moving downstream past the trap in late spring and
early summer, with unknown numbers moving during the portion of the
summer when the trap does not operate (due to high temperatures). These
fish are not accounted for in the abundance estimates, which only count
fish that move downstream later in the fall as early migrants, or in the
following spring as late migrants. Therefore the juvenile abundance
estimates for CAT underestimate the true number of juvenile fish
produced in that population, but the magnitude of this underestimate is
not known. Although a few late-spring young-of-year are typically
observed at the other screw trap sites, only CAT consistently sees large
numbers of these fish.

During the spring when hatchery smolt are released, screw traps cannot
operate continuously because the large numbers of hatchery-origin fish
can quickly overfill a trap and cause mortality. Instead, systematic
subsampling is often used to sample during hatchery release periods.
During subsampling, the traps are operated for the four hours
immediately after twilight (this period corresponds to the time of day
when the majority of fish movement typically occurs), and then shut down
for the rest of the night. Then the trap is operated continuously (24
hour sampling) before and after the subsample nights, but the number of
wild fish caught during the four-hour subsample window are counted
separately from the fish caught during the rest of the 24-hour period,
in order to determine the proportion of the full 24-hour catch that was
caught during the four-hour subsampling window. This proportion is used
to expand the catch during subsample nights to the expected number of
fish that would have been caught with 24 hours of continuous sampling.

Missing data:

- The LOS trap was not operated during migration year 2004 (BY 2002).
- The UGR trap does not have an abundance estimate for fall 2021 (BY
  2020; MY 2022) due to very limited trap operation time, and low fish
  numbers observed during the period of operation. There are also
  several other very uncertain abundance estimates from the UGR trap,
  again due to limited trap operation time and very low catch.

### Description

**Data access date:** 2023-05-02

This data set describes the estimated probability of *survival* for
PIT-tagged natural-origin juvenile Chinook salmon parr and smolt from
the time of tagging to arrival at Lower Granite Dam as smolt during the
spring outmigration. Groups of juvenile Chinook (hereafter, “tag
groups”) are captured and tagged at several different locations and time
periods during their early life history:
- Fish in the **summer** tag group are actively captured (by
  snorkel-herding) throughout the rearing habitat above the screw trap,
  over the course of approximately one week during the summer (late
  July - August). These fish are captured as parr during their
  freshwater rearing summer, approximately nine months before their
  outmigration the following spring.
- Fish in the **fall** tag group (‘early migrants’) are passively
  captured at the rotary screw trap over the course of the fall movement
  period (September - November).
- Fish in the **winter** tag group are actively captured throughout the
  rearing habitat above the screw trap, over the course of approximately
  one week in early winter (usually early December). Because these fish
  are still upstream of the screw trap at the end of the fall movement
  period, all fish in the winter tag group display the ‘late migrant’
  life history. There are no winter survival estimates for the MIN
  population. (The Minam River is almost entirely within a wilderness
  area and access is very difficult during the winter.)
- Fish in the **spring** tag group (‘late migrants’) are passively
  captured at the rotary screw trap over the course of the spring
  movement period (primarily March - April).

Survival to Lower Granite Dam is estimated with a Cormack-Jolly-Seber
model, using all detections at mainstem dams below Lower Granite as a
pooled second survival interval. Probability of detection at Lower
Granite Dam is estimated independently for each tag group. Confidence
intervals are calculated based on profile likelihood.

These survival estimates use all tagged fish that meet the following
conditions:
- PIT-tagged during the correct season.
- Not a recapture.
- Target cohort - not known to be precocious or young-of-year.

**Years of data:**

- summer:
  - CAT: 30 years (BY 1991-2020)
  - LOS: 29 years (BY 1991-2020; no BY 1996)

  - UGR: 17 years (BY 1991-1993, 2006, and 2008-2020)

- fall and spring:
  - CAT: 28 years (BY 1993-2020; no BY 2013 fall)
  - LOS: 25 years (BY 1995-2020; no BY 2002)
  - MIN: 22 years (BY 1999-2020)
  - UGR: 26 years (BY 1992-2020, with numerous missing estimates)

- winter:
  - CAT: 28 years (BY 1993-2020)
  - LOS: 26 years (BY 1995-2020)
  - MIN: 0 years *(no winter PIT-tagging in MIN population)*
  - UGR: 22 years (BY 1992-2020, with numerous missing estimates)

### Notes and limitations

Precision of the survival estimates depends on the number of fish tagged
(sample size), the probability of survival, and the probability of
detection at Lower Granite Dam and at the other mainstem dams. Many of
the calculated survival estimates have wide confidence intervals due to
a combination of these reasons. In particular, detections downstream of
Lower Granite Dam are often the rarest and most limiting piece of
information for estimating survival.

The survival estimates are assumed to be representative of the full
population (or specific portions of the population, such as early
migrants for the fall rotary screw trap survival estimates). However, in
practice the fish used to generate the survival estimates are not
necessarily a representative sample of the population. First, fish must
exceed a threshold size (usually 55 mm fork length) in order to be
marked with a PIT tag; in years and river segments where many fish are
smaller than this threshold, in practice it is only the larger portion
of the population (at the time of tagging) that is being sampled.
Second, when distributing PIT tags for the summer and winter tag groups,
the goal is to roughly match the observed density and distribution of
parr throughout the watershed. But, again, in practice this is not
necessarily achieved due to access constraints, limited sampling time,
and other logistical considerations. In practice large numbers of tags
may go out in fish from a limited spatial distribution, such that some
stream reaches are over-represented and other reaches are
under-represented in the tag group.

Missing data:
- There is a gap of nearly 15 years in the UGR summer survival
  estimates: there was no summer PIT tagging in the UGR population for
  brood years 1994-2005, nor in BY 2007.
- Most of the other populations and tag groups have occasional gaps in
  the time series of survival estimates, due to low sample size of tags
  put out or too few downstream detections to calculate a survival
  estimate. Missing estimates are especially common for UGR, where the
  population size is small and it is not uncommon to catch very few fish
  over the course of a season.

### Description

**Data access date:** 2023-01-12

This data set provides summary statistics, including *mean length* for
all recorded length measurements of natural-origin juvenile Chinook
salmon. All lengths describe **fork length in millimeters**, at the time
of capture.

Length statistics are reported by population, brood year, and tag group
(summer, fall, winter, and spring), following the structure of the
reported survival estimates (see documentation for `juv-survival`).

In most seasons, not all fish captured and measured are PIT tagged. In
fall and spring, at the rotary screw traps, this is primarily because
there are often many more fish captured than there are available PIT
tags. In the summer, in recent years this is primarily because some fish
are too small to PIT tag: since 2011, 55 mm fork length has been the
minimum size threshold for PIT tagging (fish smaller than 55 mm fork
length may not be tagged), although in earlier years the minimum
threshold was more variable (ranging from 50 mm to 65 mm, depending on
the year). Additionally, in some earlier years (brood years 2000 -
2005), large numbers of fish were captured and measured as part of a
mark-recapture population abundance estimate, creating a very large data
set of length data from non-PIT fish. In the winter, essentially all
fish captured are PIT tagged; therefore there are no length data for
non-PIT tagged fish (hereafter abbreviated as **NPT**) in winter, and
the PIT length data set is assumed to provide an adequate sample of the
population for the winter tag group.

Because in some circumstances we may want statistics for PIT tagged fish
only (i.e., the set of fish used to generate the survival estimates;
`[fish_subset] = "PIT"`), while in other circumstances we want
statistics for the full population (`[fish_subset] = "all"`), the mean
length data set reports both sets of statistics for each
population/brood year/season. The PIT tagged fish used to calculate the
mean lengths reported here are the same groups of fish that were used to
generate the survival estimates.

Grande Ronde Chinook parr usually grow rapidly during summer, and the
observed mean length of a population is strongly dependent on the day of
year when fish are captured and measured. Because the summer tagging
event occurs by active capture during a single week, and the timing of
that week has varied among years, in the GR-LCM we used a correction
factor to account for the effect of tag date on observed population mean
length.

From this full data set, the GR-LCM uses only the summer and spring tag
groups (with `[fish_subset] = "all"`) for mean length and associated
standard error.

**Source Data**

These statistics summarize all available recorded length data from fish
that meet the following conditions:
- Fish was captured above the rotary screw trap (or at it, for fall and
  spring fish); exclude any fish captured below the traps.
- Fish was unmarked at the time of the length measurement; exclude all
  recaptures.
- Fish was not recorded as precocious or fry/young-of-year (i.e., a
  younger cohort than the target age class in a given year).
- For fall and spring seasons (i.e., fish caught at the rotary screw
  traps), fish was caught between Sept 1 and Dec 15 (fall), or between
  Feb 15 and June 30 (spring). These date limits were applied to ensure
  some level of consistency and comparability among years with highly
  variable dates of trap operation.

**Years of data:**

- summer:
  - CAT: 30 years (BY 1991-2020)
  - LOS: 28 years (BY 1991-2020; no BY 1997 or 1998)
  - MIN: 30 years (BY 1991-2020)
  - UGR: 17 years (BY 1991-1993, 2006, and 2008-2020)

  - LOS: 26 years (BY 1995-2020)
  - MIN: 22 years (BY 1999-2020)

### Notes and limitations

- Although the timing of summer fish capture and tagging has largely
  remained consistent within populations over the past ~15 years, in
  earlier years the timing was more variable; in general, summer tagging
  in 1993 through ~2005 tended to happen considerably later in the year
  than summer tagging in recent years. Because fish usually grow rapidly
  during the summer, the median date of tagging (`[jday_med]`) is a
  strong predictor of population mean length. See also the discussion
  for the `juv-survival` data set.
- Fish mean size at summer tagging also depends on watershed position
  (upstream reaches vs. downstream reaches), although it explains less
  of the variation in population mean size than does median date of
  tagging. Fish in upper reaches tend to emerge later, and for a given
  date fish from the upper watershed tend to be substantially smaller
  than fish from the lower watershed. See also the discussion for the
  `juv-survival` data set.
- For summers prior to 2001, recorded length data from undersize and
  other non-PIT-tagged fish (NPT) was unavailable. But length
  distributions of PIT tagged fish from these years without NPT data
  mostly do not appear truncated, indicating that the available PIT tag
  length data are an acceptable measure of mean fish length for those
  sampling events. Exceptions are LOS summer fish from brood years 1997
  and (especially) 1998, where the distributions do show a truncation at
  the 55 mm tagging threshold, indicating that the PIT tag length data
  set is missing the smaller fish in the population. Therefore there are
  no `[fish_subset] = "all"` records for LOS summer brood years 1997 and
  1998.

**Missing data**

Some populations/years/seasons are missing or excluded from the mean
length statistics.

- **No sampling:** Length data sets are entirely missing because no
  sampling occurred (trap did not operate or there was no snorkeling
  effort).
  - fall- LOS MY04
  - winter- UGR MY96-97, MY01-03, MY09
  - summer- LOS MY98; UGR MY96-07, MY09
  - spring - no fully missing data sets, but for LOS MY04 spring the
    trap ran only during the second half of the season (April 19 - June
    18).
- **Non-tag data missing:** There are some population/seasons for which
  the data for non-PIT-tagged (NPT) fish are not available. For the
  following population/season groups, length statistics are reported for
  `[fish_subset]=PIT` but not for `[fish_subset]=all` because we do not
  have adequate data for NPT fish.
  - summer - LOS MY99 and MY00. Non-tag data are missing and PIT length
    distributions show truncation effects due (presumably) to undersize
    fish.
  - fall and spring - CAT MY97. Trap catch and PIT tag numbers for this
    migration year indicate that there were substantial numbers of
    non-tagged fish, but no non-tag data have been found.
- **Inadequate sample size:** There were several population/season
  samples (primarily trap seasons at UGR), where sampling did occur, but
  the sampling was minimal/ineffective and caught so few fish that the
  available data do not provide an adequate sample of the population. A
  minimum sample size threshold of n=50 has been applied for reporting
  mean length: if there were fewer than 50 fish measured in a given
  season then mean length in that season is reported as `NA`, in place
  of reporting a mean based on a very small sample size.
  - fall: UGR MY96-97, MY01, MY09, and MYY21
  - spring: UGR MY97, MY01, and MY09

### Description

**Data access date:** 2023-09-03

This data set describes *abundance* (number released) and *survival*
(from the time of release to arrival at Lower Granite Dam) for
hatchery-origin Chinook salmon smolts released into the CAT, LOS, and
UGR populations. There is no hatchery supplementation in the MIN
population. Fish are raised at Lookingglass Fish Hatchery and released
in the spring as age-2 smolt. In rare instances some juvenile hatchery
fish are released earlier, as age-1 parr during the fall. In this
situation the parr will overwinter in freshwater before emigrating to
the ocean in the spring.

The number of hatchery fish released into each population each year is
determined at the time of release. In the GR-LCM we assumed that these
numbers are known without error.

Survival to Lower Granite Dam is based on detections of PIT-tagged fish
at mainstem dams; the survival point estimate is calculated using a
Cormack-Jolly-Seber model, with all detections at mainstem dams below
Lower Granite Dam pooled into a second survival interval. Confidence
intervals are calculated based on profile likelihood. The existing
survival estimates for hatchery-origin juveniles are calculated
separately for each hatchery raceway. Each year, juveniles from three
different stocks are reared in separate raceways: CAT juveniles are
typically reared in two raceways, LOS juveniles in four raceways, and
UGR juveniles in four raceways. To generate a single point estimate of
survival for each population and brood year, we calculated an average of
the per-raceway survival estimates, weighted by the number of fish

**Years of data:** 24 (brood years 1997-2020)

For the LOS population, 1997 was the first brood year released; for the
CAT and UGR populations, 1998 was the first brood year released.

### Notes and limitations

The conventional hatchery program for the CAT, LOS, and UGR populations,
using endemic broodstock, was initiated with brood year 1997. Prior to
this year, there were a few releases of hatchery fish (produced with
out-of-basin broodstock) into the Upper Grande Ronde and Catherine Creek
in the 1980’s and early 1990’s. Most of these releases occurred before
the time period modeled by the GR-LCM, but some of the hatchery smolt
releases in the 1990’s could have produced returning adults during the
years being modeled. Additionally, there was a high stray rate among
hatchery-origin adults returning to the nearby Lookingglass Creek
population through the 1991 brood year cohort. Both of these events
(returning adults from early UGR and CAT releases, as well as straying
adults from Lookingglass releases) could have produced the
hatchery-origin adults in the adult return data prior to the start of
the conventional hatchery programs. For simplicity, in the GR-LCM all
these hatchery-origin adults from before the start of conventional
hatchery programs are treated as “strays”.

Most hatchery-origin juvenile fish are released in the spring as age-2
smolt, but some parr were released into the Lostine River from brood
years 2007, 2008, and 2020, and into the Upper Grande Ronde River from
brood year 2000. Although survival and adult return rates from parr
releases are much lower than they are for smolt releases, specific
survival estimates (to Lower Granite Dam) for these parr releases are
incorporated in the aggregate weighted average `[surv_est]` values. The
estimated number of smolts arriving at Lower Granite Dam (i.e., smolt
equivalents) for a given population and brood year is calculated using
the total number of fish released and the aggregate survival estimate.
This approach accounts for the different expected survival rates of parr
and smolt releases.

For brood years 1998-2011, some hatchery smolt releases were from the
“captive broodstock” program. In the Grande Ronde basin captive
broodstock program, the parents used as broodstock spent their entire
lives in the hatchery and never migrated to the ocean. In a conventional
hatchery program, adult fish returning from the ocean are used for
broodstock. Differences in adult return rates between Grande Ronde basin
captive and conventionally produced smolts have been documented
(Feldhaus et al. 2022).

### Description

**Data access date:** 2023-09-11

This data set describes annual *survival* probabilities for juvenile
natural- and hatchery-origin Chinook salmon moving downstream through
the hydrosystem, from the tailrace of Lower Granite Dam (the first
mainstem dam encountered by outmigrants) through the tailrace of
Bonneville Dam (the final dam before fish reach the ocean). Survival
estimates are calculated using a Cormack-Jolly-Seber model based on
detections of PIT-tagged fish at the dams, as well as detections at
sites downstream (primarily the estuary trawl), detections at bird
colonies and other tag recoveries, and detections of returning adults.

For the GR-LCM, hydrosystem survival estimates are origin-specific
(calculated separately for natural-origin vs. hatchery-origin fish), but
not population-specific: all populations (of a given origin) are assumed
to experience a common survival rate moving through the hydrosystem.

**Years of data**

- natural-origin: 27 (MY 1994-2021)
- hatchery-origin: 20 (MY 2002-2021)

### Source data

Hydrosystem survival estimates are calculated and provided by the
Comparative Survival Study \[CSS\] (McCann et al. 2022, Table A1). The
estimates for natural-origin fish are based on an aggregate of wild fish
PIT tagged throughout the Snake River basin (upstream of Lower Granite
Dam); this aggregation is necessary to get an adequate sample size of
PIT-tagged natural-origin fish. The estimates used in the GR-LCM for
hatchery-origin fish are based on PIT-tagged hatchery smolt from the CAT
population. Of the hatchery-supplemented populations modeled by the
GR-LCM, only CAT is included in the Comparative Survival Study.

Additional details on source data and calculation methods are provided
in McCann et al. (2022).

The data values used here were obtained by querying the Fish Passage
Center’s juvenile survival estimates
(<https://www.fpc.org/jquerymobile/apps/CSS_Sr_TIR_andD_step1.php>;
accessed 2023-09-11) with the following parameters:

- `SPECIES` = Chinook
- `Rear Type` = Hatchery AND Wild
- `Race Code` = Spring AND Spring_Summer
- `CSS GROUP` = Snake River Wild Spring_Summer Chinook AND Catherine
  Creek Hatchery Spring Chinook
- `Migration Year` = All Migration Years

### Notes and limitations

At the time when data sets were being compiled for fitting the GR-LCM,
hydrosystem survival estimates were available through 2021.

The survival estimates used here are estimated survival probabilities
only for fish that moved through the hydrosystem “in river”, i.e., the
fish that were not transported (from one of the Snake River dams to
below Bonneville Dam). The overall proportion of outgoing juvenile
Chinook that were transported varies among years. The CSS reports that
“\[t\]ypically for years after 2005 about 40 percent of the PIT-tagged
Snake River wild stocks were transported” (McCann et al. 2022). Prior to
2005, the proportion of outmigrating fish that were transported was
typically higher, usually in the range of 80% (McCann et al. 2022,
Figure 1.6). The survival of fish that were transported through the
hydrosystem is not accounted for in this data set.

The method used to calculate survival estimates in years 2006 and later
is different from the method used prior to 2006. This is because the
protocol for transport operations at the Snake River Dams changed in
2006, and simultaneously the CSS began using a different method for
assigning tagged fish to transport vs. in-river routes through the
hydrosystem. See McCann et al. (2022) for details.

Starting with the 2023 annual report, the Fish Passage Center
retrospectively used a new calculation method to revise the historical
hydrosystem survival estimates: “In 2019, the CSS implemented a new
estimation methodology. At that time, we applied this new method to
migration years 2006 and later. For this 2023 report, we applied this
new methodology to the historic years as well (1994-2005)” (McCann et
al. 2023). However, at the time the GR-LCM was developed and prepared
for publication, the revised survival estimates for years 1994-2005 were
not yet available on the Fish Passage Center website query, and so the
older versions of the survival estimates are used in this
`juv-survival-hydro` data set.

Additionally, the published estimates for the most recent migration
years (2020 and 2021) were not yet finalized at the time when this
`juv-survival-hydro` data set was compiled.

### Citation

Data were compiled and provided by Stuart Ellis, Harvest Specialist,
Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission, 2023.

### Description

This auxiliary data set provides estimates of the proportion of adult
Chinook salmon returning to the mouth of the Columbia River in each
return year that were harvested downstream of Bonneville Dam. Note that
harvest from the mainstem Columbia River upstream of Bonneville Dam is
accounted for in the `BON-LGR-adult-PIT-detections` data set.

The harvest estimates are derived through the run reconstruction process
conducted by the U.S. v. Oregon Technical Advisory Committee, which is
the state/tribal/federal body tasked with management issues for Columbia
River fisheries. The harvest estimates (which include recreational,
non-treaty commercial, and treaty fisheries) are developed using creel
data, commercial fish tickets and biological monitoring information,
and, for some treaty data, clip rate sampling data at Bonneville Dam.
Almost all non-treaty harvest downstream of Bonneville has been
mark-selective since the early 2000’s. In a mark-selective fishery
harvest regulations differ for hatchery-origin fish (i.e., adipose fin
is clipped) vs. for natural-origin fish (adipose fin intact). Often it
is legal to retain some number of hatchery-origin fish, while
natural-origin fish must be released unharmed.

The harvest rates provided in this data set apply to age-4 and age-5
fish. In the GR-LCM we assumed the harvest rate for age-3 fish was half
that of age-4 and age-5 fish to account for gillnet selectivity.

### Description

**Data access date:** 2023-04-08

This data set describes a metric of *survival* rate for adult Chinook
salmon migrating upstream through the hydrosystem (i.e., from Bonneville
Dam up to Lower Granite Dam).

For each year since 2000, the data set reports the number of unique
PIT-tagged adult spring/summer Chinook (originating from the Grande
Ronde basin) that were detected at Bonneville Dam, and then the subset
count of those unique PIT tags that were subsequently detected at Lower
Granite Dam.

For adults returning from the ocean, the probability of detecting
PIT-tagged fish as they move upstream past mainstem dams has been near
100% since the early 2000s (Crozier et al. 2016). Therefore, the
proportion of the PIT-tagged adults detected at Bonneville Dam each year
that were subsequently detected at Lower Granite Dam can be used as a
measure of survival for adults moving upstream through the hydrosystem.
This empirical survival rate (known as a “conversion rate”;
<https://www.cbr.washington.edu/dart/query/pitadult_conrate>?)
integrates all sources of mortality that fish experience during this
time, including losses due to harvest, straying, predation, and
environmental conditions.

### Source data

PIT tag detection information is maintained by the Columbia Basin PIT
Tag Information System (PTAGIS) database.

PIT tag counts from the dams were provided by the Columbia River Data
Access in Real Time (DART) website [PIT Tag Adult Returns Conversion
Rate](https://www.cbr.washington.edu/dart/query/pitadult_conrate), with
the following query parameters:

- `Conversion Reach` = Bonneville to Lower Granite
- `Species` = Chinook
- `Run` = Spring
- `Rear Type` = Wild OR Hatchery
- `Release Location` = Grande Ronde River Basin - All
- `Month Range` = January to December
- `Detections Upstream of Upper Project`: Include
- `Chinook Minijacks`: Exclude
- `Release Sites below Upper Project`: Exclude
- `Transported Fish`: Include (in-river and transport)

### Description

**Data access date:** 2020-07-10 (for return years 1991-2019);
2023-05-17 (for return years 2020-2022)

This data set provides estimated numbers of adult Chinook salmon
(*abundance*) that return annually to the mouth of their natal river.
This metric is known as “total return-to-river” (RTR), which is distinct
from the number of *spawners* present in a given year and population.
The total abundance (RTR) numbers include all adult fish (all ages, both
hatchery and natural-origin, both sexes); in the GR-LCM, we estimate the
*composition* of the annual adult return by age and origin based on the
weir and carcass data sets.

Methods for estimating the total RTR are complex and vary by population.
The field and analysis methods are described fully in Bliesner et
al. (2020), but some relevant pieces are summarized here.

There are two primary methods for estimating abundance of returning
adults, depending on whether an adult weir is present. In the three
supplemented populations (CAT, LOS, and UGR), weirs began operating in
1997. The unsupplemented MIN population does not have an adult weir.

For years and populations without a weir (i.e., all years for the MIN
population, and years prior to 1997 for the other three populations),
the abundance of returning adults is estimated based on redd counts.
Redd counts are either assumed to be a census, or counts are expanded to
account for unsurveyed space or time. The total counts are then expanded
by a standard value of 3.2 spawners per redd (2.23 in CAT). Briefly,
these values were derived from comparing mark-recapture above-weir
abundance estimates against the above-weir redd counts. Finally, this
estimated number of spawners is expanded by the estimated rate of
prespawn survival in order to calculate the total number of fish in the
river prior to prespawn mortality. There was no recorded tributary
harvest for the GR-LCM populations during any of the modeled years using
a redd-based abundance estimate, so there is no need to account for
tributary harvest in these estimates.

For years and populations where an adult weir is present (i.e., 1997 and
later for all populations except MIN), the abundance estimate is usually
based on a mark-recapture estimate of the number of adult fish above the
weir: fish that are handled at the weir are marked with an opercle
punch\[es\] before being released upstream to spawn naturally, and then
carcasses recovered during spawning ground surveys are checked for
presence or absence of the opercle punch marking (with marked carcasses
representing the “recaptures”).

The following list summarizes the logic of the weir-based adult return
to river estimates.

- First, abundance of age-4/5 fish *in the river* (i.e., before any
  prespawn mortality) above the weir is estimated, usually based on a
  mark-recapture estimate from fish marked at the weir and recovered as
  carcasses on the spawning grounds.
- Then, abundance of age-3 fish (jacks) is estimated based on a variety
  of methods. If there are enough recoveries of age-3 carcasses, then
  the mark-recapture method is preferred. More commonly, estimates are
  based on a carcass recovery rate or a weir capture rate (weir
  efficiency).
- The total estimated number of fish above the weir (age-4/5 + age-3) is
  then expanded to account for any spawning downstream of the weir,
  using the ratio of redds counted below the weir to the total number of
  redds counted in a given population and year.
- Finally, the total number of adult fish returning to the river also
  includes the fish that were removed (a) in tributary harvest (see
  `tributary-harvest`); and (b) at the weir, either to use as broodstock
  or culled to limit the proportion of hatchery-origin fish on the
  spawning grounds (see `adult-indiv-weir`).

$$Abundance = (\frac{AboveWeirAge4/5 + AboveWeirAge3}{PropReddsUpstream}) + TribHarvest + WeirRemovals$$

**Uncertainty values**

Quantifying the uncertainty associated with these composite abundance
estimates is complex.

For redd-based abundance estimates, uncertainty was estimated using a
bootstrap simulation routine. Each component of the abundance estimation
process (i.e., counting redds; expanding for unsurveyed space or time;
expanding by spawners per redd; expanding for prespawn mortality) was
simulated by drawing from a distribution based on the range of observed
values, and a total simulated abundance estimate was calculated for each
iteration. Variance of the resulting vector of simulated total abundance
values was used as the variance of the total abundance point estimate.

For weir-based abundance estimates, variances of the age-4/5 and age-3
above-weir abundance values were calculated using modifications of the
one-sample bootstrap method developed for quantifying variance
associated with screw trap abundance estimates (Thedinga et al. 1994).
To account for the additional uncertainty introduced by expanding the
above-weir abundance estimates for below-weir spawning, the coefficients
of variation for the above-weir abundance estimates were also expanded
by the same proportion applied to the abundance estimates (we used the
same method for expanding the CVs of the `juv-abundance` estimates).
Variance of the tributary harvest values was estimated by generating
bootstrap estimates from a Poisson distribution. Weir removals represent
census counts, so these values did not introduce any additional
uncertainty. Finally, the uncertainties associated with each of these
components of total abundance were aggregated by adding variances.

All uncertainty values are reported as a coefficient of variation for
the point estimate of abundance.

### Description

**Data access date:** 2023-05-03

This auxiliary data set reports the numbers of adult Chinook salmon, by
origin, sex, and age, that were harvested in tribal and sport tributary
fisheries after they returned to their natal river. Tributary harvest is
distinguished from harvest that occurs while fish are still in the ocean
or while they are migrating upstream through the mainstem Columbia and
Snake Rivers. (In the GR-LCM, these other sources of harvest are
captured in the `harvest-rates-below-BON` and
`BON-LGR-adult-PIT-detections` data sets, as well as in the ocean
survival and maturity rates estimated within the model.) Within the
GR-LCM tributary harvest counts are treated as known values without
sampling error.

Tributary harvest comprises both sport (recreational) and tribal
fisheries. Sport fisheries target hatchery-origin fish, while tribal
fisheries are non-selective and allow harvst of both hatchery- and
natural-origin fish. Nez Perce Tribe and the Confederated Tribes of the
Umatilla Indian Reservation monitor and report their annual tribal
fishery harvest numbers. Sport fishery harvest numbers are estimated
based on creel surveys; method details are provided in Bratcher et
al. (2017).

Of the populations and years modeled by the GR-LCM, only the LOS
population experiences semi-regular tributary harvest. Recorded
tributary harvest occurred only in 2012 for the CAT population (tribal
and sport fisheries), and only in 2010 and 2014-2017 for the UGR
population (tribal fisheries only). There is no tributary harvest in the
MIN population. None of the populations modeled by the GR-LCM had any
recorded tributary harvest during the low-return years 1986-2000.

This data set reports only positive harvest counts; harvest is assumed
to be zero for any population, year, or composition not included in the
data set.

### Notes and limitations

Estimates of tributary harvest (most often zero) are available for all
years and populations modeled by the GR-LCM, so there are no missing
data.

Although harvest numbers are treated as known values in the GR-LCM, in
practice there is substantial uncertainty associated with these
estimates. The sport harvest estimates are based on statistical
expansions from creel surveys, which may represent a small sample size
relative to the total harvest. The age composition of the tributary
harvest is particularly uncertain because of the low numbers of adult
fish that are physically sampled in the creel.

### Description

**Data access date:** 2023-05-09

This data set provides raw data on individual adult Chinook salmon
captured and handled at the weirs on Catherine Creek (CAT population),
the Lostine River (LOS population), and the Upper Grande Ronde River
(UGR population). There is no adult weir on the Minam River (MIN
population). The Lostine River weir is operated by the Nez Perce Tribe
(NPT). The Catherine Creek and Upper Grande Ronde weirs are operated by
the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation (CTUIR).

In the GR-LCM we used this data set (together with the
`adult-indiv-carcass` data set) to estimate the annual *composition* of
adult returns in terms of age and origin. Total age can be used to
assign adult fish back to their brood year. We also used this data set
to count the numbers of fish removed at the weir, by age and origin; we
assumed these counts are known without error.

In general, data collected for each fish handled at the weir include
length, sex, origin, and age. Sex is assessed based on morphological
characteristics. Origin is assessed based on presence or absence of an
adipose fin clip and/or a coded wire tag (CWT). A variety of different
methods are used to determine or estimate fish age, and the best
available information source for each fish is used to assign a total age
to that fish. In order of preference, these age-assessment methods
include parental-based tagging (PBT); coded wire tag recovery (CWT;
hatchery fish only); PIT tag (for fish tagged as juveniles); fin ray or
scale reading; or age-length key. Age determinations based on PBT, CWT,
or PIT tag are known without error, while age assignments based on scale
reading or age-length keys are “best guess” aging.

For the GR-LCM we classified all fish arriving at the weir as either
*removed* from the population or *passed* upstream (i.e., returned to
the river) to spawn naturally. Fish are removed at the weir for a
variety of reasons. The primary reason is broodstock collection, but
hatchery-origin fish are also removed to limit the number of hatchery
fish spawning in nature.

Some individual fish are handled at the weir more than once: this occurs
when, for example, a fish is relocated downstream but swims back up to
the weir, or when a fish passed upstream “falls back” below the weir and
then is recaptured. These recaptures can be identified by the presence
of an opercle mark(s), and all recapture records are indicated in the
data set with `[recapture] = TRUE`. In the GR-LCM, we excluded all
recaptures from the composition estimation, to ensure that each
individual was counted only once. However, we did include recaptures in
the counts of fish removed at the weir.

**Years of data:** 26 (RY 1998 - 2022)

- CAT: 25 years (RY 1998-2022)
- LOS: 18 years (RY 1997-2022; missing RY 2001-2008)
- MIN: 0 years *(No weir in the MIN population)*
- UGR: 25 years (RY 1998-2022)

### Notes and limitations

Identifying fish origin based on the presence or absence of visible
marks (termed “observational origin”) is subject to error.
Hatchery-origin fish can usually be identified by an adipose fin clip
and/or the presence of a CWT. However, assigning origin is more
challenging for the UGR population than for other populations. In most
Grande Ronde basin populations, nearly 100% of smolts have the adipose
fin clipped, and CWT rates range from 48-67% of smolts (Feldhaus et
al. 2022). But in the UGR population, only about 50% of the smolts are
marked with an adipose fin clip, and instead the goal is to mark all
smolts with a CWT. In practice a CWT is not always present or detectable
in returning adults, likely due to tag loss. In recent years, genetic
sample collection from all fish spawned at the hatchery has enabled
definitive origin assignment for most of the adult fish collected for
broodstock. These genetic data show that for the UGR population,
consistently about 10% of the adult fish assigned “Natural” origin based
on fin clip and CWT marks are actually hatchery-origin (based on
matching their genetic samples to known parents from hatchery spawning;
ODFW, unpublished data). We do not observe a similar pattern of
unidentified hatchery-origin adults in the LOS or CAT populations,
presumably because those populations have near-100% adipose clips for
hatchery smolts. To account for this known bias in origin assignment in
the UGR weir data, for the GR-LCM we applied a simple correction factor:
for return years 2006 and later (corresponding to the time period when
the adipose-clip rate for hatchery smolt settled at near 50%), we
assumed that 10% of the fish assigned “Natural” origin at the UGR weir
were actually hatchery-origin. We did not apply any origin correction
factors to the CAT or LOS populations.

The weirs are intended to operate continuously during the run of adult
fish each year. However, high water temperatures at the Upper Grande
Ronde River weir usually necessitate removing the weir before the run is
complete. High flows can also damage or disable weirs. The overall
efficiency of the adult weir varies among populations and among years.
We never assumed that weir counts are a census of all fish on the
spawning grounds above the weir. Additionally, some fish spawn
downstream of the weirs.

In the GR-LCM we assumed that fish trapped at the weir provide an
unbiased sample of the full population of returning adult fish. However,
arrival timing at the weirs differs between age-3 vs. age-4/5 adults,
with the age-3 fish arriving on average about one to two weeks later
than older fish (Beer 2007; ODFW, unpublished data). Different arrival
timing may result in different weir efficiency, especially when age-3
fish are more likely to arrive after the weir has been removed for the
season.

### Description

**Data access date:** 2023-05-09

This data set provides raw data on individual adult Chinook salmon
carcasses recovered during spawning ground surveys. Chinook spawning
ground surveys in the Grande Ronde Basin are a collaborative effort
between ODFW, NPT, and CTUIR.

In the GR-LCM we used this data set (together with the
`adult-indiv-weir` data set) to estimate the annual *composition* of
adult returns in terms of age and origin. Total age can be used to
assign adult fish back to their brood year.

This same carcass data set was also used to generate the pre-spawn
survival estimates (see notes for the `prespawn-survival` data set).

For populations that have an adult weir (i.e., all except MIN), many of
the carcasses recovered during spawning ground surveys are fish that
were previously handled and documented at the weir. Fish that were
previously handled at the weir can be identified by an opercle punch
marking, but there is no way to definitively match individual marked
carcasses back to their corresponding individual record in the weir
data. The numbers of marked vs. unmarked carcasses recovered during
spawning ground surveys are used for the mark-recapture estimation of
fish abundance above the weir (see notes for the `adult-abundance` data
set).

In general, data collected for each carcass recovery include length,
sex, origin, age, spawn status (for females), and presence/absence of
opercle punch markings. However, the condition of the carcass determines
what information can be collected. For example, it may be impossible to
collect fork length or to determine sex or origin on carcasses that are
badly decomposed or that have been scavenged. For this reason, some
carcass records have missing data.

Sex of a carcass is determined by external morphological characteristics
and confirmed by opening the body cavity and examining the gonads.
Origin is assessed based on presence or absence of an adipose fin clip
and/or a coded wire tag (CWT). A variety of different methods are used
to determine or estimate fish age, and the best available information
source for each fish is used to assign a total age to that fish. In
order of preference, these age-assessment methods include parental-based
tagging (PBT); coded wire tag recovery (CWT; hatchery fish only); PIT
tag (for fish tagged as juveniles); fin ray or scale reading; or
age-length key. Age determinations based on PBT, CWT, or PIT tag are
known without error, while age assignments based on scale reading or
age-length keys are “best guess” aging.

**Years of data:** 32 (RY 1991 - 2022; no carcasses recovered from the
UGR population in 1994 or 1999)

### Notes and limitations

Carcass collection is limited by when spawning ground surveys occur.
Sometimes planned surveys must be skipped due to (for example) wildfire
or a landowner denying permission to access the site. Most spawning
reaches are surveyed multiple times during the spawning season, and
carcasses are more likely to be recovered during the late surveys, when
most fish have completed spawning. If the last survey of a reach is
skipped, then this will likely result in reduced carcass recovery rates.

Carcass recovery rates vary among populations. Wilderness streams -
i.e., the Minam River, among the GR-LCM populations - tend to have very
low carcass recovery probabilities, presumably due to relatively higher
abundances of scavengers. Carcass recovery probability is also very low
on the Upper Grande Ronde River, due to a combination of heavy scavenger
pressure, limited surveyor access to spawning reaches, and (in most
years) low numbers of fish (ODFW, unpublished data).

Carcass recovery probability is biased by fish size and sex. Larger fish
(i.e., age-4 and age-5) are more likely to be recovered than smaller
fish (i.e., age-3) (Murdoch et al. 2010; Zhou 2002; ODFW, unpublished
data). Additionally, females are more likely to be recovered than males,
presumably due to behavioral differences: females are likely to die at
or very near their redd, and those locations are the most closely
observed by surveyors (Hoffnagle et al. 2008; Murdoch et al. 2010; ODFW,
unpublished data).

In the GR-LCM, we corrected for biased carcass recovery probabilities
when using carcass data to estimate age composition of returning adult
fish.

### Description

**Data access date:** see `adult-indiv-carcass` data set

This auxiliary data set provides annually estimated rates of prespawn
survival for returning adult Chinook salmon. We fit a binomial model
predicting prespawn survival in each population and return year based on
observed spawn status in carcass recoveries, and then supplied the
estimated prespawn survival rates to the GR-LCM as known values. The
source data for the prespawn survival model was the
`adult-indiv-carcass` data set.

“Prespawn survival” here describes the probability of survival from the
time that potential spawning begins to successful spawning.

Rates of prespawn survival are estimated based on observed spawn status
of female carcass recoveries. Females are considered `Spawned` if less
than 50% of eggs remain in the body cavity. The relative numbers of
successfully spawned vs. unspawned female carcasses can be used to
roughly estimate the rate of prespawn mortality (or, equivalently,
prespawn survival) in a given population and return year. However, in
many years - primarily in the UGR and MIN populations - fewer than 20
female carcasses were recovered, which limits our ability to estimate
annual prespawn survival rates using only carcass recoveries from that
year.

We noted some consistent differences among populations in prespawn
survival rates. Survival tends to be higher in the MIN and CAT
populations, and lowest in the UGR population. There is also some
evidence that prespawn survival for a given population varies annually.
Other studies have found increased rates of prespawn mortality
associated with higher mean stream temperatures during the spawning
period (Bowerman et al. 2021), which may drive some of the observed
variability in prespawn survival rates among years.

For the GR-LCM, we used the carcass recovery data to fit
population-specific logistic mixed models of prespawn survival rate
assuming a time constant mean with logit-normal annual random effects.

### Notes and limitations

The terms “prespawn survival” or “prespawn mortality” can be used to
describe survival over a range of different time periods in adult
salmonid life history. Broadly, the term can refer to “non-fishery
mortality of adult salmon and steelhead between the time the fish enter
the Columbia River and the completion of spawning” (Johnson et
al. 2007). More commonly, it refers to mortality between returning to
the spawning area (i.e., after completing migration) and successful
spawning (Bowerman et al. 2018). Because this carcass data set is
limited to data collecting during the spawning period, in practice the
sampling method captures only mortality during this brief time period
(about three weeks). Bowerman et al. (2021) describe this distinction as
the “holding period” (after adults have returned to the spawning area
and completed migration but before the initiation of spawning) vs. the
“spawning period”.

For the GR-LCM, mortality between Bonneville Dam and Lower Granite Dam
is captured in the `BON-LGR-adult-PIT-detections` converstion rate data
set; mortality during the spawning period is captured in the
`prespawn-surv` data set; but adult mortality between Lower Granite Dam
and the start of the spawning period is not captured in the data sets
used to fit the GR-LCM.

Low sample sizes of recovered carcasses with known spawn status in some
years and populations limit our ability to make strong inferences about
prespawn mortality rates. This is especially problematic for the UGR
population, where carcass recoveries are consistently very low. A radio
tracking study (Crump et al. 2021) of adult Chinook salmon in the UGR
population suggests that prespawn survival rates are both low and highly
variable among years. We have limited information available to
characterize this important source of mortality in the UGR population.
Carcass recovery rates are also low in the MIN population, but observed
prespawn survival rates there are consistently high.

### Description

**Data access date:** 2023-05-19

This auxiliary data set provides values for the expected fecundity (eggs
produced per female) for returning adult Chinook salmon by age (age-4
vs. age-5), population, and year. In the GR-LCM, fecundity is treated as
a known value.

Data for Chinook salmon fecundity in the Grande Ronde Basin are
available through hatchery spawning records, where ~30-80 female fish
from each of the CAT, LOS, and UGR populations are spawned annually
(since 2001) at Lookingglass Fish Hatchery. The fecundity of each female
is measured (using an automatic egg counter) and recorded. After eggs
hatch, egg counts are validated against auto-trailer counts of juveniles
in each hatchery raceway.

For the GR-LCM, we used mean length of returning adult females (by age,
population, and year) to predict mean fecundity for each year and
population. Expected fecundity of a given fish is correlated with fish
size: larger fish produce more eggs (ODFW, unpublished data). Because
fish size is related to fish age, age can be used as a simple
categorical predictor of fecundity. In development of the GR-LCM, there
was concern that using static age-based estimates for fecundity could
obscure differences among populations in mean size-at-age, or changes in
size-at-age over time.

To estimate year- and population-specific fecundity values for the
GR-LCM, we first used all available hatchery spawning records from the
GR-LCM populations to fit a linear model predicting individual fecundity
as a function of fork length. Then we used all available weir and
carcass records to calculate the mean length of returning females in
each year and population, by age (age-4 and age-5). Finally, we used
these mean length values in the linear model to predict mean fecundity
for each age, year, and population. Although it would have been simpler
to use the spawning data to directly estimate mean fecundity by age in
each year and population, there were too many missing data points to
make this approach viable for the GR-LCM: hatchery fecundity records do
not start until 2001, while the GR-LCM extends back to 1991.
Additionally, there are no fecundity data for MIN, because there is no
hatchery supplementation in this population. Calculating fecundity based
on mean length allowed us to extend the population- and year-specific
fecundity estimates to years and populations that lack direct fecundity
estimates.

### Notes and limitations

Age-3 females are rare, and this life history pathway is excluded from
the GR-LCM. Almost all fish that return at age-3 are males. Therefore,
we calculated fecundity estimates for age-4 and age-5 females only.

Calculating mean length of returning adult females by age, year, and
population was limited by small sample sizes in some years and
populations. This is especially true for age-5 fish; in the years
modeled by the GR-LCM, age-4 fish were always more common than age-5
fish. To ensure adequate sample sizes for robust estimation of mean
length, we pooled some populations and years together for calculating
means:
- The CAT, UGR, and MIN population length (by age) values were pooled
  together, within each return year, while mean lengths for the LOS
  population were estimated separately. LOS fish tend to be larger (for
  a given age) than fish from the other three populations.
- The years 1991-2000 had consistently low sample sizes across all
  populations, especially for age-5 fish. This was due to a combination
  of no weir data for 1991-1996 (and limited data from the early years
  of weir operation), plus low fish return numbers during the 1990s.
  Therefore years 1991-2000 were pooled together (within each
  population) for estimating mean length at age.
