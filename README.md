# GR-sslcm-data
> Data for use in the Grande Ronde state-space life cycle model

This repository has been set up separately from the parent [GR-sslcm](https://www.github.com/bstaton1/GR-sslcm) repository in order to ensure that the contents will remain private.  ODFW policy requires that any publicly available data exactly match the official version of record.  Maintaining a private data repository allows us to work freely with draft and provisional data sets during model development.
