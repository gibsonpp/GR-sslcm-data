### Description

This data set describes the *abundance* of natural origin juvenile
Chinook observed passing rotary screw traps as the fish move downstream
out of spawning areas in the headwaters.

Abundance is measured using rotary screw traps, located near the lower
extent of spawning in each population. Generally the screw traps operate
during two seasons, corresponding to the primary periods of fish
movement: fall (early migrants) and spring (late migrants). In general
ice cover (winter) and high temperatures (summer) prevent the traps from
operating year-round, although the trap on the Lostine River is usually
able to operate through most of the winter. Very few fish are caught
during this winter period.

Mark-recapture trials for measuring the efficiency of the screw traps
are conducted by releasing marked fish above the trap throughout the
sampling season (Volkhardt et al. 2007). Up through migration year 2019,
abundance was calculated using the Lincoln-Petersen estimator, with no
attempt to account for missed trapping days. For migration years 2020
and later, abundance was estimated using a generalized additive model
with a penalized spline smooth term, which smooths the curve for
estimated daily abundance passing the trap and interpolates for missed
trapping days during the sampling season (Duarte and Peterson 2020). For
all years, variance of the abundance estimates was estimated using the
one-sample bootstrap method (Thedinga et al. 1994).

Because rotary screw traps only catch fish moving downstream past the
trap, they do not count fish that were spawned downstream of the trap.
In order to account for the contribution of any downstream spawning to
juvenile production, in this data set the estimates of of the number of
fish passing the screw traps are expanded by the ratio of the number of
redds (from the appropriate brood year) counted above the screw trap to
the total number of redds counted in the population for that brood year.

**Years of data:** 29 (BY 1992 - 2020)

- CAT: 28 years (BY 1993-2020)

- LOS: 25 years (BY 1995-2020; missing BY 2002)

- MIN: 22 years (BY 1999-2020)

- UGR: 28 years (BY 1992-2020; missing part of BY 2019)

### Notes and limitations

The primary limitation affecting migrant abundance estimates from screw
traps is missed trapping days during the migration period: traps
sometimes must be shut down for heavy debris loads, ice cover, or very
high flows, and data may be unusable due to, for example, a log jamming
the trap. In the pre-2019 abundance estimates, no attempt was made to
account for these missed days, so the number and timing of missed days
can strongly influence the total abundance estimate for the season.
Additionally, any migrants that pass the trap before the start or after
the end of trapping are not counted in the abundance estimates.

At the Catherine Creek trap site, substantial numbers of young-of-year
fish are regularly observed moving downstream past the trap in late
spring and early summer, with unknown numbers moving during the portion
of the summer when the trap does not operate (due to high temperatures).
These fish are not accounted for in the abundance estimates, which only
count fish that move downstream later in the fall as early migrants, or
in the following spring as late migrants. Therefore the juvenile
abundance estimates for Catherine Creek underestimate the true number of
juvenile fish produced in that population, but the magnitude of this
underestimate is not known. Although a few late-spring young-of-year are
typically observed at the other screw trap sites, only Catherine Creek
consistently sees large numbers of these fish.

During the spring when hatchery smolt are released, screw traps cannot
operate continuously because the large numbers of hatchery origin fish
can quickly overfill a trap and cause mortality. Instead, systematic
subsampling is often used to sample during hatchery release periods.
During subsampling, the traps are operated for the four hours
immediately after twilight (this period corresponds to the time of day
when the majority of fish movement typically occurs), and then shut down
for the rest of the night. In order to calibrate this subsampling, the
trap is operated continuously (24 hour sampling) before and after the
subsample nights, but the number of wild fish caught during the
four-hour subsample window are counted separately from the fish caught
during the rest of the 24-hour period, in order to determine the
proportion of the full 24-hour catch that was caught during the
four-hour subsampling window. This proportion is used to expand the
catch during subsample nights to the expected number of fish that would
have been caught with 24 hours of continuous sampling.

Missing data:

- The Lostine River trap was not operated during migration year 2004 (BY
  2002).

- The Upper Grande Ronde River trap does not have an abundance estimate
  for fall 2021 (BY 2020; MY 2022) due to very limited trap operation
  time, and low fish numbers observed during the period of operation.
  There are also several other very uncertain abundance estimates from
  the UGR trap, again due to limited trap operation time and very low
  catch.

### Description

This data set describes the estimated probability of *survival* for
PIT-tagged natural origin juvenile Chinook parr and smolt from the time
of tagging to arrival at Lower Granite Dam as smolt during the spring
outmigration. Groups of juvenile Chinook (hereafter, “tag groups”) are
captured and tagged at several different locations and time periods
during their early life history:

- Fish in the **summer** tag group are actively captured (by
  snorkel-herding) throughout the rearing habitat above the screw trap,
  over the course of approximately one week during the summer (late
  July - August). These fish are captured as parr during their
  freshwater rearing summer, approximately nine months before their
  outmigration the following spring.

- Fish in the **fall** tag group (‘early migrants’) are passively
  captured at the rotary screw trap over the course of the fall movement
  period (September - November).

- Fish in the **winter** tag group are actively captured throughout the
  rearing habitat above the screw trap, over the course of approximately
  one week in early winter (usually early December). Because these fish
  are still upstream of the screw trap at the end of the fall movement
  period, all fish in the winter tag group display the ‘late migrant’
  life history. There are no winter survival estimates for the Minam
  population. (The Minam is a wilderness river and access is very
  difficult during the winter.)

- Fish in the **spring** tag group (‘late migrants’) are passively
  captured at the rotary screw trap over the course of the spring
  movement period (primarily March - April).

Survival to Lower Granite Dam is estimated with a Cormack-Jolly-Seber
model, using all detections at mainstem dams below Lower Granite as a
pooled second survival interval. Probability of detection at Lower
Granite Dam is estimated independently for each tag group. Confidence
intervals are calculated based on profile likelihood.

These survival estimates use all tagged fish that meet the following
conditions:

- PIT-tagged during the correct season.

- Not a recapture.

- Target cohort - not known to be precocious or young-of-year.

**Years of data:**

  - CAT: 30 years (BY 1991-2020)

  - LOS: 29 years (BY 1991-2020; no BY 1996)

### Notes and limitations

Precision of the survival estimates depends on the number of fish tagged
(sample size), the probability of survival, and the probability of
detection at Lower Granite Dam and at the other mainstem dams. Many of
the calculated survival estimates have very wide confidence intervals
for a combination of these reasons. In particular, detections downstream
of Lower Granite Dam are often the rarest and most limiting piece of
information for estimating survival.

The survival estimates are assumed to be representative of the full
population (or specific portions of the population, such as early
migrants for the fall rotary screw trap survival estimates). However, in
practice the fish used to generate the survival estimates are not
necessarily a representative sample of the population. First, fish must
exceed a threshold size (usually 55 mm fork length) in order to be
marked with a PIT tag; in years and river segments where many fish are
smaller than this threshold, in practice it is only the larger portion
of the population (at the time of tagging) that is being sampled.
Second, when distributing PIT tags for the summer and winter tag groups,
the goal is to roughly match the observed density and distribution of
parr throughout the watershed. But, again, in practice this is not
necessarily achieved due to access constraints, limited sampling time,
and other logistical considerations. In practice large numbers of tags
may go out in fish from a very limited spatial distribution, such that
some stream reaches are over-represented and other reaches are
under-represented in the tag group.

Missing data:

- There is a gap of nearly 15 years in the UGR summer survival
  estimates: there was no summer PIT tagging in the UGR population for
  brood years 1994-2005, nor in BY 2007.

- Most of the other populations and tag groups have occasional gaps in
  the time series of survival estimates, due to low sample size of tags
  put out or too few downstream detections to calculate a survival
  estimate. Missing estimates are especially common for UGR, where the
  population size is small and it is not uncommon to catch very few fish
  over the course of a season.

### Description

This data set provides summary statistics, including *mean length* for
all recorded length measurements of natural origin juvenile Chinook. All
lengths describe **fork length in millimeters**, at the time of capture.

Length statistics are reported by population, brood year, and tag group
(summer, fall, winter, and spring), following the structure of the
reported survival estimates (see documentation for `juv-survival`).

In most seasons, not all fish captured and measured are PIT tagged. In
fall and spring, at the rotary screw traps, this is primarily because
there are often many more fish captured than there are available PIT
tags. In the summer, in recent years this is primarily because some fish
are too small to PIT tag: since 2011, 55 mm fork length has been the
minimum size threshold for PIT tagging (fish smaller than 55 mm fork
length may not be tagged), although in earlier years the minimum
threshold was more variable (ranging from 50 mm to 65 mm, depending on
the year). Additionally, in some earlier years (brood years 2000 -
2005), large numbers of fish were captured and measured as part of a
mark-recapture population abundance estimate, creating a very large data
set of length data from non-PIT fish. In the winter, essentially all
fish captured are PIT tagged; therefore there are no length data for
non-PIT tagged fish (hereafter abbreviated as **NPT**) in winter, and
the PIT length data set is assumed to provide an adequate sample of the
population for the winter tag group.

Because in some circumstances we may want statistics for PIT tagged fish
only (i.e., the set of fish used to generate the survival estimates;
`[fish_subset] = "PIT"`), while in other circumstances we want
statistics for the full population (`[fish_subset] = "all"`), this mean
length data set reports both sets of statistics for each
population/brood year/season (with a few exceptions). The PIT tagged
fish used to calculate the mean lengths reported here are the same
groups of fish that were used to generate the survival estimates.

Grande Ronde Chinook parr usually grow rapidly during summer, and the
observed mean length of a population is strongly dependent on the day of
year when fish are captured and measured. Because the summer tagging
event occurs by active capture during a single week, and the timing of
that week has varied among years, in the GR-LCM we used a correction
factor to account for the effect of tag date (as day of year) on
observed population mean length.

From this full data set, the GR-LCM uses only the summer and spring tag
groups (with `[fish_subset] = "all"`) for mean length and associated
standard error.

**Source Data**

These statistics summarize all available recorded length data from fish
that meet the following conditions:

- Fish was captured above the rotary screw trap (or at it, for fall and
  spring fish); exclude any fish captured below the traps.

- Fish was unmarked at the time of the length measurement; exclude all
  recaptures.

- Fish was not recorded as precocious or fry/young-of-year (i.e., a
  younger cohort than the target age class in a given year).

- Fish was not captured as part of parr collection for captive
  broodstock (occurred only in CAT and LOS, for brood years 1994 and
  1995).

- For fall and spring seasons (i.e., fish caught at the rotary screw
  traps), fish was caught between Sept 1 and Dec 15 (fall), or between
  Feb 15 and June 30 (spring). These date limits were applied to ensure
  some level of consistency and comparability among years with highly
  variable dates of trap operation.

**Years of data:**

  - CAT: 30 years (BY 1991-2020)

  - LOS: 28 years (BY 1991-2020; no BY 1997 or 1998)

### Notes and limitations

- Although the timing of summer fish capture and tagging has largely
  remained consistent within populations over the past ~15 years, in
  earlier years the timing was more variable; in general, summer tagging
  in 1993 through ~2005 tended to happen considerably later in the year
  than summer tagging in recent years. Because fish usually grow rapidly
  during the summer, the median date of tagging (`[jday_med]`) is a
  strong predictor of population mean length. See also the discussion
  for the `juv-survival` data set.

- Fish mean size at summer tagging also depends on watershed position
  (upstream reaches vs. downstream reaches), although it explains less
  of the variaion in population mean size than does median date of
  tagging. Fish in upperr reaches tend to emerge later, and for a given
  date fish from the upper watershed tend to be substantially smaller
  than fish from the lower watershed. See also the discussion for the
  `juv-survival` data set.

- For summers prior to 2001, recorded length data from undersize and
  other non-PIT-tagged fish (NPT) was sparse, inconsistent, and
  difficult to track down. For brood years 1991 and 1996 - 1999, no
  recorded length data for summer NPT fish have been found, and it is
  unclear whether this is because there simply were no undersize fish in
  those years, vs. lengths of undersize fish were not recorded during
  those years. But length distributions from the years without NPT data
  mostly do not appear truncated, indicating that the available PIT tag
  length data are an acceptable measure of mean fish length for those
  sampling events; the exceptions are Lostine summer fish from brood
  years 1997 and (especially) 1998, where the distributions do show a
  truncation at the 55 mm tagging threshold, indicating that the PIT tag
  length data set is missing the smaller fish in the population.
  Therefore there are no `[fish_subset] = "all"` records for Lostine
  summer brood years 1997 and 1998.

- In a few cases in the summer data, individual lengths were recorded
  for the first ~20 undersize fish, and thereafter undersize fish were
  only tallied. In order to account for these fish in the length summary
  statistics, we simulated length values for the tallied undersize fish
  records by sampling from the data set of measured undersize lengths
  from a given population and year, limited to fish captured within a
  few river kilometers of the tallied fish.

**Missing data**

Some populations/years/seasons are missing or excluded from the mean
length statistics.

- **No sampling:** Length data sets are entirely missing because no
  sampling occurred (trap did not operate or there was no snorkeling
  effort).

  - fall- LOS MY04

  - winter- UGR MY96-97, MY01-03, MY09

  - summer- LOS MY98; UGR MY96-07, MY09

  - spring - no fully missing data sets, but for LOS MY04 spring the
    trap ran only during the second half of the season (April 19 - June
    18).

- **Non-tag data missing:** There are some population/seasons for which
  the data for non-PIT-tagged (NPT) fish either were not collected or
  have not yet been found. For the following population/season groups,
  length statistics are reported for `[fish_subset]=PIT` but not for
  `[fish_subset]=all` because we do not have adequate data for NPT fish.

  - summer - LOS MY99 and MY00. Non-tag data are missing and PIT length
    distributions show truncation effects due (presumably) to undersize
    fish.

  - fall and spring - CAT MY97. Trap catch and PIT tag numbers for this
    migration year indicate that there were substantial numbers of
    non-tagged fish, but no non-tag data have been found.

- **Inadequate sample size:** There were several population/season
  samples (primarily trap seasons at UGR), where sampling did occur, but
  the sampling was minimal/ineffective and caught so few fish that the
  available data do not provide an adequate sample of the population. A
  minimum sample size threshold of n=50 has been applied for reporting
  mean length: if there were fewer than 50 fish measured in a given
  season then mean length in that season is reported as `NA`, in place
  of reporting a mean based on a very small sample size.

  - fall: UGR MY96-97, MY01, MY09, and MYY21

  - spring: UGR MY97, MY01, and MY09

### Description

This data set describes *abundance* (number released) and *survival*
(from the time of release to arrival at Lower Granite Dam) for
hatchery-origin juvenile fish released into the Catherine Creek,
Lostine, and Upper Grande Ronde populations. (There is no hatchery
supplementation in the Minam population.) Fish are raised at the
hatchery and released typically in the spring as age-2 smolt, at which
point most fish immediately begin their migration out to the ocean. In
rare instances some of the hatchery fish for a given population and
brood year are released earlier, as age-1 parr during the fall, and in
this situation the fish will overwinter in freshwater before migrating
out to the ocean in the spring.

The number of hatchery fish released into each population each year is
measured at the hatchery (based on estimates of fish per pound), and in
the model we assumed that these numbers are known without error.

Survival to Lower Granite Dam is based on detections of PIT-tagged fish
at mainstem dams; the survival point estimate is calculated using a
Cormack-Jolly-Seber model, with all detections at mainstem dams below
Lower Granite pooled into a second survival interval. Confidence
intervals are calculated based on profile likelihood. The existing
survival estimates for hatchery-origin juveniles are calculated
separately for each hatchery raceway (in a given brood year each
population at the hatchery is distributed among ~4 different raceways);
different raceways may have different release dates or, in the earlier
years of hatchery operations, contain fish from different hatchery
programs (i.e., fish from the captive broodstock program vs. fish from
the conventional program). In order to generate a single point estimate
of survival for each population and brood year for use in the GR-LCM, we
calculated an average of the per-raceway survival estimates, weighted by
the number of fish released from each raceway.

**Years of data:** 24 (brood years 1997-2020)

For the LOS population, 1997 was the first brood year released; for the
CAT and UGR populations, 1998 was the first brood year released.

### Notes and limitations

The conventional hatchery program for the Catherine Creek, Lostine
River, and Upper Grande Ronde River populations, using endemic
broodstock, was initiated with brood year 1997. Prior to this year,
however, there were some inconsistent releases of hatchery fish (from
out-of-basin broodstock) into the Upper Grande Ronde and Catherine Creek
in the 1980’s and early 1990’s. Most of these releases occurred before
the time period being modeled by the GR-LCM, but some of the 1990’s
releases could have produced returning adults during the time period
being modeled. Additionally, releases of fish from out-of-basin stocks
into the nearby Lookingglass Creek population through 2001 (brood year
1999) produced high rates of straying in the returning adults. Both of
these events (returning adults from early UGR and CAT releases, as well
as straying adults from Lookingglass releases) could have produced the
hatchery-origin adults seen in the adult return data prior to the start
of the conventional hatchery programs. For simplicity, in the GR-LCM all
of these hatchery-origin adults from before the start of conventional
hatchery programs are treated as “strays” (i.e., extra adults simply
added into the population as needed, rather than being generated by
spawners and moved through all the modeled processes).

Most hatchery-origin juvenile fish are released in the spring as smolt
(or pre-smolt), but there have been a few instances where part of a
hatchery brood year cohort was released as parr: Lostine brood years
2007, 2008, and 2020; and Upper Grande Ronde brood year 2000. Although
rates of survival and eventual adult returns from parr releases are much
lower than they are for equivalent smolt releases, specific survival
estimates (to Lower Granite Dam) for these parr releases are included in
the aggregate weighted average `[surv_est]` values, and so overall the
estimated of number of smolt arriving at Lower Granite Dam (i.e., smolt
equivalents) for a given population and brood year using the aggregate
release number and survival estimate accounts for the different expected
survival of parr vs. smolt releases.

For brood years 1998-2011, some of the hatchery-origin fish released
included fish from the “captive broodstock” program. In a captive
broodstock program, the fish used as broodstock spend their whole lives
in the hatchery and never migrate out to the ocean; whereas in a
conventional hatchery program, adult fish returning from the ocean are
captured to use as broodstock. Whether a fish’s parents came from the
conventional vs captive broodstock program is known to affect the fish’s
probability of survival to Lower Granite Dam, but these different
expected survival rates are accounted for in the individual survival
estimates by raceway.

### Description

This data set describes annual *survival* probabilities for juvenile
natural- and hatchery-origin fish moving downstream through the
hydrosystem, from the tailrace of Lower Granite Dam (the first mainstem
dam encountered by outmigrants) through the tailrace of Bonneville Dam
(the final dam before fish reach the ocean). Survival estimates are
calculated using a Cormack-Jolly-Seber model based on detections of
PIT-tagged fish at the dams, as well as detections at sites downstream
(primarily the estuary trawl), detections at bird colonies and other tag
recoveries, and detections of returning adults.

For the GR-LCM, hydrosystem survival estimates are origin-specific
(calculated separately for natural-origin vs. hatchery-origin fish), but
not population-specific: all populations (of a given origin) are assumed
to experience a common survival rate moving through the hydrosystem.

**Years of data**

- natural origin: 27 (MY 1994-2021)

- hatchery origin: 20 (MY 2002-2021)

### Source data

Hydrosystem survival estimates are calculated and provided by the
Comparative Survival Study \[CSS\] (McCann et al. 2022, Table A1). The
estimates for natural-origin fish are based on an aggregate of wild fish
PIT tagged throughout the Snake River basin (upstream of Lower Granite
Dam); this aggregation is necessary in order to get an adequate sample
size of PIT-tagged natural-origin fish. The estimates used in the GR-LCM
for hatchery-origin fish are based on PIT-tagged hatchery smolt from the
Catherine Creek population. (Of the hatchery-supplemented populations
modeled by the GR-LCM, only Catherine Creek is included in the
Comparative Survival Study.)

Additional details on source data and calculation methods are provided
in McCann et al. (2022).

The data values used here were obtained by querying the Fish Passage
Center’s juvenile survival estimates
(<https://www.fpc.org/jquerymobile/apps/CSS_Sr_TIR_andD_step1.php>;
accessed 2023-09-11) with the following parameters:

- `SPECIES` = Chinook

- `Rear Type` = Hatchery AND Wild

- `Race Code` = Spring AND Spring_Summer

- `CSS GROUP` = Snake River Wild Spring_Summer Chinook AND Catherine
  Creek Hatchery Spring Chinook

- `Migration Year` = All Migration Years

### Notes and limitations

At the time when data sets were being compiled for fitting the GR-LCM,
hydrosystem survival estimates were available through 2021, and the 2022
annual report was the most recent available published annual report.

The survival estimates being used here are estimated survival
probabilities only for fish that moved through the hydrosystem “in
river”, i.e., the fish that were not transported (from one of the Snake
River dams to below Bonneville). The overall proportion of outgoing
juvenile Chinook that were transported varies among years. The CSS
reports that “\[t\]ypically for years after 2005 about 40 percent of the
PIT-tagged Snake River wild stocks were transported” (McCann et
al. 2022). Prior to 2005, the proportion of outmigrating fish that were
transported was typically higher, usually in the range of 80% (McCann et
al. 2022, Figure 1.6). The survival of fish that were transported
through the hydrosystem is not accounted for in this data set.

The method used to calculate survival estimates in years 2006 and later
is different from the method used in earlier years. This is because the
protocol for transport operations at the Snake River Dams changed in
2006, and simultaneously the CSS began using a different method for
assigning tagged fish to transport vs. in-river routes through the
hydrosystem. See McCann et al. (2022) for details.

Starting with the 2023 annual report, the Fish Passage Center
retrospectively used a new calculation method to revise the historical
hydrosystem survival estimates: “In 2019, the CSS implemented a new
estimation methodology. At that time, we applied this new method to
migration years 2006 and later. For this 2023 report, we applied this
new methodology to the historic years as well (1994-2005)” (McCann et
al. 2023). However, at the time the GR-LCM was developed and prepared
for publication, the revised survival estimates for years 1994-2005 were
not yet available on the Fish Passage Center website query, and so the
older versions of the survival estimates are used in this
`juv-survival-hydro` data set.

Additionally, the published estimates for the most recent migration
years (2020 and 2021) were not yet finalized at the time when this
`juv-survival-hydro` data set was compiled.

## Adult: harvest-rates-below-BON

### Citation

Data were compiled and provided by Stuart Ellis, Harvest Specialist,
Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fish Commision. 2023.

### Description

This auxiliary data set provides estimates of the proportion of adult
fish returning to the mouth of the Columbia River in each return year
that were harvested downstream of Bonneville Dam. (Note that harvest
from the mainstem Columbia River upstream of Bonneville Dam is accounted
for in the `BON-LGR-adult-PIT-detections` data set.) 

The harvest estimates are derived through the run reconstruction process conducted by the U.S. v. Oregon Technical Advisory Committee, which is state/tribal/federal body tasked with management issues for Columbia River fisheries. The harvest estimates (which include recreational, non-treaty commercial, and treaty fisheries) are developed using creel data, commercial fish tickets and biological monitoring information, and, for some treaty data, clip rate sampling data at Bonneville Dam. Almost all non-treaty harvest downstream of Bonneville has been mark-selective since the early 2000’s. In a mark-selective fishery harvest regulations differ for hatchery-origin fish (i.e., adipose fin is clipped) vs. for natural-origin fish (adipose fin intact). Often it is legal to retain some number of hatchery-origin fish, while natural-origin fish must be released unharmed.

The harvest rates provided in this data set apply to age-4 and age-5
fish. In the GR-LCM we assumed the harvest rate for age-3 fish was half
that of age-4 and age-5 fish to account for gillnet selectivity.

### Description

This data set describes a metric of *survival* rate for adults migrating
upstream through the hydrosystem (i.e., from Bonneville Dam up to Lower
Granite Dam).

For each year since 2000, the data set gives the number of unique
PIT-tagged adult spring/summer Chinook (originating from the Grande
Ronde basin) that were detected at Bonneville Dam, and then the subset
count of those unique PIT tags that were subsequently detected at Lower
Granite Dam. The probability of survival for upstream migrating fish is
roughly estimated as the ratio of the number of tags counted at Lower
Granite Dam to the number of tags counted at Bonneville; this metric is
known as a “conversion rate”. Rates are estimated separately for
natural- and hatchery-origin fish.

Although not a true survival estimate, this simple method still provides
a good index of upstream survival rates because the probability of
detection at Lower Granite and Bonneville for PIT-tagged adults moving
upstream is very high - estimated at over 98% at all dams since 2006
(Crozier et al. 2016).

For adults returning from the ocean, the probability of detecting
PIT-tagged fish as they move upstream past mainstem dams has been near
100% since the early 2000s (Crozier et al. 2016, or other study?).
Therefore the proportion of the PIT-tagged adults detected at Bonneville
Dam in a given year that were subsequently detected at Lower Granite Dam
can be used as a measure of survival for adults moving upstream through
the hydrosystem. This empirical survival rate (known as a “conversion
rate” <https://www.cbr.washington.edu/dart/query/pitadult_conrate>?)
integrates all sources of mortality that fish experience during this
time, including losses due to harvest, straying, predation, and
environmental conditions.

For the GR-LCM we chose to use this simple, empirical metric of upstream
survival rather than attempting to separately quantify rates of
mortality and loss due to harvest, straying, predation, environmental
conditions, etc.

### Description

This data set provides estimates of the number of adult fish
(*abundance*) that return to the mouth of their natal river each year.
This metric is known as “total return-to-river” (RTR), which is distinct
from the number of *spawners* present in a given year and population.
The total abundance (RTR) numbers include all adult fish (all ages, both
hatchery and natural origin, both female and male); in the GR-LCM, we
estimate the *composition* of these returning adults by age and origin
each year based on the weir and carcass data sets.

Methods for estimating the total RTR are complex and vary depending on
presence or absence of an adult weir, sample size, and other factors.
The field and analysis methods are described in detail in Bliesner et
al. (2020), but some relevant pieces are summarized here.

There are two primary methods for estimating abundance of returning
adults, depending on whether an adul weir is present. In the three
supplemented populations (Catherine Creek, Lostine River, and Upper
Grande Ronde River), weirs began operating in 1997. The unsupplemented
Minam River population does not have an adult weir.

For years and populations without an adult weir (i.e., all years for the
Minam population, and years prior to 1997 for the other three
populations), the abundance of returning adults is estimated based on
expansions from redd counts. Redd counts are either assumed to be a
census, or counts are expanded to account for unsurveyed space or time.
Then the total number of redds is expanded by a standard value of 3.2
spawners per redd (2.23 in Catherine Creek), which was derived from
comparing mark-recapture estimates of above-weir of spawner abundance
(see below) against the above-weir redd counts from those years.
Finally, this estimated number of spawners is expanded by the estimated
rate of prespawn survival in order to calculate the total number of fish
in the river prior to prespawn mortality. When there is an adequate
sample size of carcass recoveries, the prespawn mortality rate can be
estimated from the number of spawned vs. unspawned female carcasses
recovered (see `prespawn-surv` data set). However, for most of the years
using a redd-based abundance estimate, carcass recovery numbers tend to
be low, and in practice a static estimate of 0.90 was often used for the
prespawn survival rate. There was no recorded tributary harvest for the
GR-LCM populations during any of the modeled years using a redd-based
abundance estimate, so there is no need to account for tributary harvest
in these estimates.

For years and populations where an adult weir is present (i.e., 1997 and
later for all populations except Minam), the primary estimate of
abundance is usually based on a mark-recapture estimate of the number of
adult fish above the weir: fish that are handled at the weir are marked
with an opercle punch\[es\] before being released upstream to spawn
naturally, and then carcasses recovered during spawning ground surveys
are checked for presence or absence of the opercle punch marking (with
marked carcasses representing the “recaptures”). While this estimation
method is straightforward, in practice the full weir-based RTR estimates
are more complex. First, the abundance of age-3 fish (“jacks”) is
estimated separately from the abundance of age-4 and age-5 fish, because
jacks tend to have a lower probability of being handled at the weir and
a substantially lower probability of being recovered on the spawning
grounds, relative to age-4 and age-5 fish. Second, the sample size of
recovered marked carcasses is not always large enough to provide a
robust mark-recapture abundance estimate. In this situation, alternative
methods (usually based on estimated carcass recovery rates) are used to
estimate above weir abundance; details of the alternative methods used
have varied over time and among populations, depending on sample sizes
and weir efficiency. Third, weir-based abundance estimation methods only
cover fish spawning upstream of the weirs, and must be expanded to
account for any spawning that occurs downstream.

The following list summarizes the logic of the weir-based adult return
to river estimates.

- First, abundance of age 4/5 fish *in the river* (i.e., before any
  prespawn mortality) above the weir is estimated, usually based on a
  mark-recapture estimate from fish marked at the weir and recovered as
  carcasses on the spawning grounds.

  - In a few cases - mostly in the UGR population, plus two early years
    (1997 and 2000) in the Catherine Creek population) - above-weir
    abundance of age 4/5 fish is estimated based on redd counts. This is
    either a redd count expansion (as described above), or predicting
    from a regression of fish above weir as a function of the above-weir
    redd count, from years with good mark-recapture abundance estimates.

- Then, abundance of age-3 fish (jacks) is estimated based on a variety
  of methods. If there are enough recoveries of age-3 carcasses (this is
  rare), then the mark-recapture method is preferred. More commonly,
  estimates are based on a carcass recovery rate or a weir capture rate
  (weir efficiency). In general, abundance estimates for the age-3 fish
  are substantially more problematic and more uncertain than the age-4/5
  abundance estimates.

  - For estimates based on a *carcass recovery rate* (all years in
    Lostine, some later years in Catherine Creek and Upper Grande
    Ronde), the recovery rate may be estimated as (a) observed jack
    carcass recovery rate (number of marked jack carcasses recovered
    relative to number of marked jacks released upstream of the
    weir); (b) half the observed age-4/5 carcass recovery rate (based on
    the relationship between observed age-3 vs. age-4/5 recovery rates
    in years with good jack carcass ample sizes); or (c) a static
    estimate of 0.10 for jack carcass recovery rate.

  - For estimates based on weir efficiency (most early weir years in
    Catherine Creek and Upper Grande Ronde), weir efficiency is
    estimated using the age-4/5 population estimate (total number
    trapped relative to the sum of the above-weir abundance estimate
    plus the number removed at the weir); then, the total number of
    jacks trapped is expanded by the estimated weir efficiency (after
    accounting for jacks that were trapped at the weir and either
    removed or passed above the weir).

- The total estimated number of fish above the weir (age-4/5 + age-3) is
  then expanded to account for any spawning downstream of the weir,
  using the ratio of redds counted below the weir to the total number of
  redds counted in a given population and year.

  - The extent of below-weir spawning varies among the populations; the
    Lostine population tends to have the most below-weir spawning (mean
    annual proportion of total Lostine redds that are below the weir =
    0.15) relative to other populations, while the Catherine Creek
    population usually has the least below-weir spawning (mean annual
    proportion = 0.02). The UGR population is intermediate (mean annual
    proportion = 0.05).

- Finally, the total number of adult fish returning to the river also
  includes the fish that were removed (a) in tributary harvest (see
  `tributary-harvest`); and (b) at the weir, either to use as broodstock
  or culled to limit the proportion of hatchery-origin fish on the
  spawning grounds (see `adult-indiv-weir`).

$$Abundance = (\frac{AboveWeirAge45 + AboveWeirAge3}{PropReddsUpstream}) + [TribHarvest] + [WeirRemovals]$$

Quantifying the uncertainty associated with these complex, composite
abundance estimates is similarly complex.

For redd-based abundance estimates, uncertainty was estimated using a
bootstrap simulation routine. Each component of the abundance estimation
process (counting redds; expanding for unsurveyed space or time;
expanding by spawners per redd; expanding for prespawn mortality) was
simulated by drawing from a distribution based on the range of observed
values, and a total simulated abundance estimate was calculated for each
iteration. Variance of the resulting vector of simulated total abundance
values was used as the variance of the total abundance point estimate.

For weir-based abundance estimates, variances of the age-4/5 and age-3
above-weir abundance values were calculated using modifications of the
one-sample bootstrap method developed for quantifying variance
associated with screw trap abundance estimates (Thedinga et al. 1994).
To account for the additional uncertainty introduced by expanding the
above-weir abundance estimates for below-weir spawning, the coefficients
of variation for the above-weir abundance estimates were also expanded
by the same proportion applied to the abundance estimates (we used the
same method for expanding the CVs of the `juv-abundance` estimates).
Variance of the tributary harvest values was estimated by generating
bootstrap estimates from a Poisson distribution. Weir removals represent
census counts, so these values did not introduce any additional
uncertainty. Finally, the uncertainty associated with each of these
components of total abundance was aggregated by adding variances.

All uncertainty values are reported as a coefficient of variation for
the point estimate of abundance.

### Description

This auxiliary data set reports the numbers of adult fish, by origin,
sex, and age, that were harvested (i.e., removed from the spawning
population) after they returned to their natal river. “Tributary
harvest” is distinguished from harvest that occurs while fish are still
in the ocean or while they are migrating upstream through the mainstem
Columbia and Snake Rivers. (In the GR-LCM, these other sources of
harvest are captured in the `harvest-rates-below-BON` and
`BON-LGR-adult-PIT-detections` data sets, as well as in the ocean
survival and maturity rates estimated within the model.) Within the
GR-LCM these tributary harvest counts are treated as known values
without associated sampling error.

Of the populations and years modeled by the GR-LCM, only the Lostine
population experiences regular tributary harvest, although even in
Lostine there have been numerous years with very low or zero tributary
harvest. For the Catherine Creek population, tributary harvest occurred
only in 2021, and for the Upper Grande Ronde population tributary
harvest occurred in a few years (2010 and 2014-2017). There is no
tributary harvest in the Minam population. None of the populations
modeled by the LCM had any recorded tributary harvest during the mostly
low-return years 1986-2000.

This data set reports only positive harvest counts; harvest for any
populations, years, and/or compositions not included in the data set is
assumed to be zero.

Tributary harvest comprises both sport (recreational) and tribal
fisheries. Sport fisheries target only hatchery-origin fish (although
there may be incidental angling-related mortality of natural-origin
fish), while tribal fisheries are non-selective by fish origin. Tribal
nations (Nez Perce Tribe and the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla
Indian Reservation) monitor and report their annual tribal fishery
harvest numbers. Sport fishery harvest numbers are estimated based on
creel surveys; method details are provided in Bratcher *et al.* (2017).

### Notes and limitations

Estimates of tributary harvest (most often zero) are available for all
years and populations modeled by the LCM, so there are no missing data.

Although harvest numbers are treated as known values in the LCM, in
practice there is substantial uncertainty associated with these
estimates. The sport harvest estimates are based on statistical
expansions from creel survey data, which may represent a small sample
size relative to the total harvest. The age compositition of the
tributary harvest is particularly uncertain, because of the uncertainty
in assigning ages to individual fish in most cases (see discussion in
the documentation for the `adult-indiv-weir` data set) as well as the
uncertainty due to sampling variability.

### Description

This data set provides raw data on individual adult fish captured and
handled at the adult weirs on Catherine Creek (`CAT` population), the
Lostine River (`LOS` population), and the Upper Grande Ronde River
(`UGR` population). There is no adult weir on the Minam River (`MIN`
population). The Lostine River weir is operated by the Nez Perce Tribe
(NPT), and the Catherine Creek and Upper Grande Ronde weirs are operated
by the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation (CTUIR).

In the GR-LCM we used this data set to estimate *composition* of the
returning adults each year, in terms of age and origin. We also used
this data set to count the numbers of fish removed at the weir, by age
and origin; these counts are assumed to be known without error.

In general, data collected for each fish handled at the weir include
length, sex, origin, and age. Most records describe individual fish
(`[count]` = 1), but there are some cases where a single record is used
to describe multiple fish (`[count]` \> 1). Sex is determined as best as
possible from morphological characteristics. Origin is determined based
on presence or absence of an adipose fin clip and/or a coded wire tag
(CWT). A variety of different sources of information are used to
determine or estimate the age of a fish, and the best available
information source for each fish is used to assign an age to that fish.
In order of preference, these methods include parental-based tagging
(PBT; i.e., genetic identification of parents and thus of brood year);
coded wire tag recovery (CWT; hatchery fish only); PIT tag (for fish
tagged as juveniles); fin ray or scale reading; or age-length key. Age
determinations based on PBT, CWT, or PIT tag are essentially known
without error, while age assignments based on scale reading or
age-length keys are “best guess” aging. For most weir records the best
age value has already been identified (in the `[best_age]` field), but
there were some instances where a fish had no assigned `[best_age]`, but
did have a value for one of the other age fields; in this situation, for
the GR-LCM we used one of the other available age values (if any),
according to the preferred order.

Although in general hatchery origin can be identified from an adipose
fin clip, plus, often, the presence of a CWT, origin assignment is more
challenging for the UGR population. Only about 50% of the
hatchery-origin smolt released into UGR each year have adipose fin clips
(the rate is near 100% for the other populations). Instead the hatchery
smolt are theoretically 100% marked with CWT, but in practice these CWT
are not always present or detectable in returning adults (presumably due
to tag loss). In recent years, genetic sample collection from all fish
spawned at the hatchery has enabled definitive origin assignment for
many of the adult fish collected for broodstock at the weirs. These
genetic data show that a fairly consistent ~10% of the adult fish
assigned “Natural” origin when they were collected at the UGR weir are,
in fact, hatchery origin (based on matching their genetic samples to
known parents from hatchery spawning; ODFW, unpublished data). This same
pattern, of a consistent proportion of fish that are actually
hatchery-origin being assigned “natural” origin at the weir, is not seen
in the Lostine or Catherine Creek populations, presumably because those
populations have near-100% adipose clips for hatchery smolt. In order to
account for this known bias in origin assignment in the UGR weir data,
for the GR-LCM we applied a simple correction factor: for return years
2006 and later (corresponding to the time period when the adipose-clip
rate for hatchery smolt settled at or near 50%), we assumed that 10% of
the fish assigned “Natural” origin at the UGR weir were actually
Hatchery origin, and within the GR-LCM the origin composition for each
2006+ return year in UGR is adjusted accordingly. (We did not apply any
origin correction to the CAT or LOS populations.)

The adult weirs are intended to operate continuously during the run of
adult fish each year, but in some cases high water temperatures
(especially at the Upper Grande Ronde weir) necessitate removing the
weir before the run is complete. High flows can also damage or disable
weirs. The overall efficiency of the adult weir varies among populations
and among years, but weir counts are never assumed to be a census of all
fish on the spawning grounds above the weir. Additionally, to varying
degrees among populations, some fish spawn downstream before ever
arriving at the weir.

For the GR-LCM we classified all fish arriving at the weir as either
*removed* from the population or *passed* upstream (i.e., returned to
the river) to attempt to spawn naturally. Fish are removed at the weir
for a variety of reasons, including outplants for additional harvest
opportunity and limiting the numbers of hatchery-origin fish on the
spawning grounds, but the primary reason is to collect broodstock for
spawning at the hatchery. The distinction between fish that are
*removed* vs. *passed* is more complicated for the Lostine population:
some adults arriving at the Lostine weir are “outplanted” down to the
lower Wallowa River (downstream of the Lostine weir) to provide
additional harvest opportunity. However, in the weir data set provided
here, these lower Wallowa outplants are classified as *passed* because
they may (if not havested) return to the Lostine River and spawn there,
meaning that for the accounting used within the GR-LCM these individuals
remain within the population of potential spawners. (Fish that are
removed via the lower Wallowa “tributary” harvest are accounted for in
the `tributary-harvest` data set.)

Some individual fish are handled at the weir more than once: this occurs
when, for example, a fish outplanted downstream swims back up to the
weir, or when a fish passed upstream “falls back” below the weir and
then is recaptured. These recaptures can be identified by the presence
of an opercle mark(s), and all recapture records are indicated in the
data set with `[recapture] = TRUE`. In the GR-LCM, we excluded all
recaptures from the composition estimation, to ensure that each
individual was counted only once. However, we did include recaptures in
the counts of fish removed at the weir.

### Notes and limitations

In the GR-LCM we assumed that fish trapped at the weir provide an
unbiased sample of the full population of returning adult fish. However,
the weirs are known to be less efficient at catching age-3 fish than
they are at catching age-4 and age-5 fish (ODFW, unpublished data),
meaning that the proportion of age-3 fish in the returning population is
likely underestimated.

We also assumed that the recorded age and origin values are known
without error. In practice, however, both are subject to error -
especially age. Parental-based-tagging, CWT recovery, and some PIT tag
records provide known age, but all other age assignments are estimates
based on scale reading or age-length keys. For origin, identifying
hatchery origin usually relies on presence of an adipose fin clip and/or
a CWT, and these indicators are not always present in true
hatchery-origin fish (especially for the UGR population, as described
above).

Although the weirs all began operating in 1997 or 1998, these initial
years experienced low trap efficiency and caught very few fish. But all
traps were running effectively by the early 2000s.

Data collection at the Lostine weir in 2001-2008 is known to be
problematic, and in the GR-LCM we excluded these years of data from the
composition estimates (composition for the Lostine population in these
years was estimated based only on carcass recoveries, as for the Minam
population). However, we did use these 2001-2008 data to tally fish
removed at the weir.

### Description

This data set provides raw data on individual adult fish, collected from
carcasses recovered during spawning ground surveys. In the GR-LCM, both
carcass data and weir data are used to estimate the composition (in
terms of age and origin) of the population of returning adult fish in
each return year. Through estimated age, returning adult fish can be
assigned back to their brood year of origin.

This same carcass data set was also used to generate the pre-spawn
survival estimates (see notes for the `prespawn-survival` data set).

Chinook spawning ground surveys in the Grande Ronde Basin are funded by
the Lower Snake River Compensation Plan and conducted by co-managers
CTUIR, NPT, and ODFW.

For populations that have an adult weir (i.e., all except Minam), many
of the carcasses recovered during spawning ground surveys are fish that
were previously handled and documented at the weir (before being
released back to the river to spawn naturally). Fish that were
previously handled at the weir can be identified by an opercle punch
marking, but there is no way to definitively match individual marked
carcasses back to their corresponding individual record in the weir
data. The numbers of marked vs. unmarked carcasses recovered during
spawning ground surveys are used for the mark-recapture estimation of
fish abundance above the weir (see notes for the `adult-abundance` data
set).

For all carcass recoveries, surveyors attempt to collect data on fork
length; sex; origin (based on presence or absence of an adipose fin clip
and/or CWT); spawn status (for females); and presence or absence of
opercle punch markings. However, the condition of the carcass determines
what information can be collected (for example, if the carcass’s tail
has been eaten by a scavenger then fork length cannot be measured),
meaning that many carcass records have missing data.

As in the weir data set, a variety of different sources of information
are used to determine or estimate the age of a fish, and the best
available information source for each fish is used to assign an age to
that fish. In order of preference, these methods include parental-based
tagging (PBT; i.e., genetic identification of parents and thus of brood
year); coded wire tag recovery (CWT; hatchery fish only); PIT tag (for
fish tagged as juveniles); fin ray or scale reading; or age-length key.
Age determinations based on PBT, CWT, or PIT tag are essentially known
without error, while age assignments based on scale reading or
age-length keys are “best guess” aging.

**Years of data:** 32 (RY 1991 - 2022; no carcasses recovered from the
UGR population in 1994 or 1999)

### Notes and limitations

Carcass collection is limited by when spawning ground surveys occurred
in a given year and population. Sometimes planned surveys have to be
skipped due to (for example) wildfire or a landowner denying permission
to access the site. Most spawning reaches are surveyed multiple times
during the spawning season, and carcasses are more likey to be recovered
during the late surveys, when a majority of fish have completed
spawning. If the last survey of a reach is skipped, then this will
likely result in missing most of the carcass recovery opportunities.
Later surveys are more likely to encounter carcasses.

Some populations have much higher carcass recovery probabilities than
others. Wilderness streams - i.e., the Minam River, among the GR-LCM
populations - tend to have very low carcass recovery probabilities,
presumably due to relatively higher abundances of scavengers. Carcass
recovery probability is also very low on the Upper Grande Ronde River,
due to a combination of heavy scavenger pressure and (in most years) low
numbers of fish (ODFW, unpublished data).

Carcass recovery probability is biased by fish size and sex. Larger fish
are more likely to be recovered than smaller fish, and recoveries of
age-3 (“jacks”) carcasses are especially rare, relative to recoveries of
age-4 and age-5 carcasses (Murdoch et al. 2010; Zhou 2002; ODFW,
unpublished data). Additionally, females are more likely to be recovered
than males, presumably due to behavioral differences: females are likely
to die at or very near their redd, and those locations are the most
closely observed by surveyors (Murdoch et al. 2010; ODFW, unpublished
data).

In the GR-LCM, we corrected for biased carcass recovery probabilities
when using carcass data to estimate sex and age composition of returning
adult fish.

## Adult: prespawn-surv

### Citation

See `adult-indiv-carcass` data set.

### Description

This auxiliary data set provides estimated rates of prespawn survival
for each population and return year modeled by the GR-LCM. We fit a
binomial model predicting prespawn survival in each population and
return year based on observed spawn status in carcass recoveries, and
then supplied the estimated prespawn survival rates to the GR-LCM as
known values. The source data for the prespawn survival model was the
`adult-indiv-carcass` data set.

“Prespawn survival” here describes the probability of survival from the
time that potential spawning begins to successful spawning.

Rates of prespawn survival are estimated based on observed spawn status
of carcass recoveries. For all female carcasses recovered, surveyors
attempt to determine whether the fish spawned successfully (few eggs
remain) vs. the fish died befored spawning (large number of eggs still
in the body cavity). The relative numbers of successfully spawned
vs. unspawned carcasses can be used to roughly estimate the rate of
prespawn mortality (or, equivalently, prespawn survival) in a given
population and return year. However, in many years the numbers of
eligible carcasses recovered are very low - primarily in the UGR and
Minam populations - which does not allow for robust estimation of an
overall prespawn survival rate using only carcass recoveries from that
year.

Analysis of the existing carcass recovery data indicated that there are
some consistent differences among populations in prespawn survival
rates: survival tends to be higher in the MIN and CAT populations, and
lower in the LOS and, especially, UGR populations. There is also some
evidence that prespawn survival for a given population varies among
years, at least in the UGR population. Other studies have found
increased rates of prespawn mortality associated with higher mean stream
temperatures during the spawning period (Bowerman et al. 2021), which
may drive some of the observed variability in prespawn survival rates
among years.

For the GR-LCM, we used the carcass recovery data as described above to
fit population-specific logistic mixed models assuming a time constant
mean with logit-normal annual random effects.

### Notes and limitations

The terms “prespawn survival” or “prespawn mortality” can be used to
describe survival over a range of different time periods in adult
salmonid life history. At its broadest, the term can refer to
“non-fishery mortality of adult salmon and steelhead between the time
the fish enter the Columbia River and the completion of spawning”
(Johnson et al. 2007). More commonly, it refers to mortality between
returning to the spawning area (i.e., after completing migration) and
successful spawning (Bowerman et al. 2018). But, because in this data
set the spawning ground surveys where carcasses might be recovered
typically occur only during the spawning period, in practice the
sampling method captures only mortality during this brief time period
(about three weeks). Bowerman et al. (2021) describe this distinction as
the “holding period” (after adults have returned to the spawning area
and completed migration but before the initiation of spawning) vs. the
“spawning period”.

For the GR-LCM, mortality between Bonneville Dam and Lower Granite Dam
is captured in the `BON-LGR-adult-PIT-detections` “converstion rate”
data set; and mortality during the spawning period is captured in the
pre-spawn survival data set; but adult mortality between Lower Granite
Dam, arriving on the spawning grounds, and holding until spawning
begins, is not captured in the data sets used to fit the GR-LCM.

Low sample sizes of recovered carcasses with known spawn status in many
years and populations limit our ability to make strong inferences about
prespawn mortaltiy rates. This is especially problematic for the Upper
Grande Ronde population, where carcass recoveries are consistently very
low (due to a combination of low adult fish numbers and low recovery
rates), but the available evidence (including some data from
radio-tracking of returning adults; Crump et al. 2021) suggests that
prespawn survival rates in this population are both low and highly
variable among years. So we have only limited information available to
characterize this important source of mortality in the UGR population.
Carcass recovery rates also tend to be low in the Minam population, but
observed prespawn survival rates there are consistently high across
years.

## Adult: fecundity

### Description

This auxiliary data set provides values for the expected fecundity (eggs
produced per female) for returning adult fish by age (age-4 vs. age-5),
population, and year. In the GR-LCM, fecundity is treated as a known
value.

Extensive data on fecundity of Chinook in the Grande Ronde Basin are
available through the records from hatchery spawning, where ~30-80
female fish from each of the CAT, LOS, and UGR populations are spawned
in the hatchery each year (beginning in 2001), and the fecundity of each
female spawned is measured (using an automatic egg counter) and
recorded. After hatch, egg counts are validated against auto-trailer
counts of juveniles in each hatchery raceway.

For the GR-LCM, we used mean length of returning adult females (by age,
population, and year) to predict mean fecundity for each year and
population. Expected fecundity of a given fish is strongly related to
fish size: larger fish produce more eggs (ODFW, unpublished data).
Because fish size is related to fish age, age can be used as a simple
categorical predictor of fecundity. In development of the GR-LCM,
however, there was some concern that using static age-based estimates
for fecundity could obscure differences among populations in mean
size-at-age, or changes in size-at-age over time.

In order to estimate year- and population-specific fecundity values for
the GR-LCM, we first used all available hatchery spawning records from
the GR-LCM populations to fit a linear model predicting individual
fecundity as a function of fork length. Then we used all available weir
and carcass records to calculate the mean length of returning females in
each year and population, by age (age-4 and age-5). Finally, we used
these mean length values in the linear model to predict mean fecundity
for each age, year, and population. Although it would have been simpler
to use the spawning data directly to estimate mean fecundity by age in
each year and population, there were too many missing data points to
make this approach viable for the GR-LCM: hatchery spawning records do
not start until 2001, while the model extends back to 1991.
Additionally, there are no spawning data for Minam population, because
there is no hatchery supplementation in this population. Calculating
fecundity based on mean length allowed us to extend the population- and
year-specific fecundity estimates out to these years and populations for
which there is no direct spawning data.

### Notes and limitations

Age-3 females are rare (almost all fish that return at age-3 are males),
and this life history pathway is excluded from the GR-LCM. Therefore we
calculated fecundity estimates for age-4 and age-5 females only.

Calculating mean length of returning adult females by age, year, and
population was limited by small sample sizes in some years and
populations. This is especially true for age-5 fish; in the years
modeled by the GR-LCM age-4 fish are always more common than age-5. In
order to ensure adequate sample sizes for robust estimation of mean
length, we pooled some populations and years together for calculating
means:

- The CAT, UGR, and MIN population length (by age) values were all
  pooled together, within each return year.
  - The UGR population usually has very few carcass recoveries, and
    often very low numbers of returning adults at all, resulting in
    small sample sizes for length in most years. We pooled UGR fish with
    CAT fish for estimating mean length, because existing data for CAT
    and UGR show very similar length-at-age data among the two
    populations. The two populations (CAT and UGR) are also relatively
    close to one another geographically.

  - The MIN population also has consistently low sample sizes (with no
    weir in this population, the only length data come from carcass
    recoveries, which are rare in the Minam). We initially thought to
    pool the Minam population with the Lostine for the mean length
    estimation, but examination of the available length data showed that
    Minam lengths tended to be closer to the CAT and UGR populations
    than to the LOS population. Therefore, the MIN, UGR, and CAT
    populations were all pooled together, while LOS lengths were
    estimated separately. Lostine fish tend to be larger (for a given
    age) than fish from the other three populations.
- The years 1991-2000 had consistently low sample sizes across all
  populations, especially for age-5 fish. This was due to a combination
  of no weir data for 1991-1996 (and limited data from the early years
  of weir operation), plus just very low fish return numbers overall
  during the 1990s. Therefore years 1991-2000 were pooled together
  (within each population) for estimating mean length at age.
